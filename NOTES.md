# Demos

## Day 1: MNase-seq

- Download reads from GEO 
- Process manually: Map them with bowtie2
- bamCoverage: CPM, only 135-160bp

## Day 2: ChIP-seq

- Process manually: map Scc1 ChIP-seq
- bamCoverage: IP/input ratios
- Call peaks
- Find motifs

## Day 3: RNA-seq

- Process snakemake: map stranded RNA 
- Check strandness
- Check overlap with Scc1 ChIP-seq 

## Day 4: ATAC-seq 

- Process with Nextflow
- G2 and overlap with Scc1 peaks

## Day 5: Hi-C

- Process with hicstuff
- G2 and overlap with Scc1 peaks
