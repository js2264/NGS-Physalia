# RStudio {-}

Rstudio offers a graphical interface 
to facilitate the interaction between a user and an underlying 
programming language (this is sometimes called IDE, or 
integrated development environment). It can be very useful when a user is 
not necessarily proficent with command line-based computing. However, such graphical interfaces are not 
always able to connect to services such as AWS.
